- Use `WHERE cancellation IS null` to count out the cancelled orders.
- `GROUP BY` `order_id` to show the results for each order.
- `ORDER BY` `max_pizzas_ordered` in descending order.
- `LIMIT 1` to show only the first result, which is the maximum number of pizzas delivered.
### Answer
The maximum number of pizzas that were delivered in a single order is 3.

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
#### ðŸ’» SQL Query
```sql
SELECT customer_orders_clean.customer_id,
SUM(CASE 
	WHEN exclusions IS NOT null OR extras IS NOT null THEN 1
    ELSE 0
  END) AS at_least_1_change,
  SUM(CASE 
	WHEN exclusions IS null AND extras IS null THEN 1
    ELSE 0
  END) AS no_changes
FROM customer_orders_clean
JOIN runner_orders_clean 
	ON customer_orders_clean.order_id = runner_orders_clean.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS null
GROUP BY customer_orders_clean.customer_id
ORDER BY customer_orders_clean.customer_id;
```
#### ðŸ–Š Result

| customer_id | at_least_1_change | no_changes |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 101         | 0                 | 2          |
| 102         | 0                 | 3          |
| 103         | 3                 | 0          |
| 104         | 2                 | 1          |
| 105         | 1                 | 0          |

#### ðŸ“œ Explanation
- Use `CASE WHEN...ELSE` to create two columns:
  - `at_least_1_change`: counts orders where ingredients were either excluded (exclusions) or added (extras).
  - `no_changes`: counts orders with no modifications.
- `INNER JOIN` the tables `customer_orders_clean` and `runner_orders_clean` on `order_id` to get the information for cancelled orders.
- Filter out cancelled orders with `WHERE cancellation IS null`.
- `GROUP/ORDER BY` customer_id.

### Answer
- Customer 101: No changes in their orders.
- Customer 102: No changes in their orders.
- Customer 103: Made 3 changes in their orders.
- Customer 104: No changes in 1 order and made 3 changes in another.
- Customer 105: Made 1 change in their orders.
