      <p><strong>Case - Problem Statement</strong></p>
      <p>Danny was inspired by an Instagram post ‚Äî ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù. He loved the idea but knew pizza alone wouldn‚Äôt secure funding. So, he combined it with an Uber-style delivery model and launched *Pizza Runner*. He recruited runners to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house), built a mobile app, and, as a data scientist, began collecting data for his business. He requires assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.</p>
