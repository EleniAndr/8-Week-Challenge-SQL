# 8-Week-Challenge-SQL

I chose to participate in the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) as a fun and practical way to grow my SQL skills. The case studies simulate real business scenarios, making the learning process both engaging and meaningful. Throughout the challenge, I gained hands-on experience in data exploration, cleaning, and querying — key tools in any data analyst’s toolkit. This experience helped me:

🧠 Reinforce my understanding of database structures and relationships

⚙️ Improve efficiency in data retrieval and manipulation

📈 Build confidence writing complex queries for real-world scenarios
